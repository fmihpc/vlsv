***** CHANGES IN REVISION 00284 *****
*************************************

Cleaned up code in vlsvwriter2.cpp and vlsvreader2.cpp as well as in
the associated headers. General-use functions have been templatized
and moved to vlsv_common.h

VLSVParReader now works after several bug fixes.

Makefile was updated so that architecture-dependent flags etc. are
read from user-dependent Makefile.ARCH files. As a result VLSV library
needs to be compiled with
>make "ARCH=arch"
command, where 'arch' is the suffix of the architecture file.
