***** VERSION 1.100.10 *****
****************************

vlsv::Writer and vlsv::ParallelReader were modified to work with very
large arrays (size roughly exceeding 2^31-1 bytes).

This version number refers to a Github commit. The revision numbers 
below refer to earlier Subversion commits.

*************************************
***** CHANGES IN REVISION 00842 *****
*************************************

MINOR

Added more VTK cell types to VLSV headers and to Visit generic
unstructured mesh plugin.

Changed some tab intendations to whitespace ones.

*************************************
***** CHANGES IN REVISION 00401 *****
*************************************

MINOR

Changed namespace VLSV to vlsv to be in line with coding style used
elsewhere. Also changed couple class names.

Mesh types, datatypes, and coordinate systems are now inside nested
namespaces. This prevented some name clashes.

Abovementioned changes had to be made in plugin as well.

*************************************
***** CHANGES IN REVISION 00386 *****
*************************************

VLSV reader was split into two files - one for sequential and one for
parallel (MPI) reader class. Sequential reader does not need
mpi-related headers etc. to compile which helps to avoid issues when
including VLSV headers.

Class MuXML had to be hidden inside namespace muxml because of
typename clash with headers that VisIt includes.

All files required by VLSVReader class have to be compiled with -fPIC
switch so that compiler can include them in shared library.

Corrected a typo in vlsv_reader.h header -- readArray function takes 
'begin' and 'amount' as parameters, not 'begin' and 'end'.

Added a 'read' convenience function which automatically converts read
data into given datatype.

First version of VisIt VLSV plugin is now ready.

Changed filenames.

*************************************
***** CHANGES IN REVISION 00284 *****
*************************************

Cleaned up code in vlsvwriter2.cpp and vlsvreader2.cpp as well as in
the associated headers. General-use functions have been templatized
and moved to vlsv_common.h

VLSVParReader now works after several bug fixes.

Makefile was updated so that architecture-dependent flags etc. are
read from user-dependent Makefile.ARCH files. As a result VLSV library
needs to be compiled with
>make "ARCH=arch"
command, where 'arch' is the suffix of the architecture file.
